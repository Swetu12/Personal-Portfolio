        "An enthusiastic web developer with practical experience in software support and web development. I specialise in front-end development and Strapi backend connection to create smooth digital experiences, and I'm passionate about building user-friendly, high-performing websites. I've been able to work on a range of projects thanks to my journey, and I concentrate on responsive design, quick load times, and user-friendly interfaces that create websites that are both useful and interesting. I bring a strong problem-solving approach and a commitment to learning from my practical experience as a helpdesk intern and my current transfer to a software development internship at Kyocera. I can hone my technical abilities and use them in practical software development situations thanks to my position at Kyocera. I'm committed to continuously improving my expertise and staying up-to-date with the latest web development trends to deliver cutting-edge solutions for every project.",
