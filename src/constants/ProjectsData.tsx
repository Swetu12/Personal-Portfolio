          "This AI chatbot was built with three main goals in mind:\n\n" +
          "✅ Showcase my skills in building scalable frontend applications.\n\n" +
          "✅ Boost productivity by creating a tool that saves time.\n\n" +
          "✅ Extend our business (Dimasc) with a smart chatbot feature under a subdomain.\n\n" +
          "✨ Although this is the MVC version, the application has much bigger potential. We're planning to integrate a custom V0 API, Supabase, and GitHub templates to create components, boilerplates, and configurations that allow us to start new projects with a solid base—skipping boring boilerplate code and jumping straight into the core functionality.\n\n" +
          "🏗️ Development Insights:\n" +
          "👨‍💻 Frontend (by Alexandru Geroc):\n" +
          "✅ Built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS 4.0.\n" +
          "✅ Focused heavily on code quality, performance, and scalability.\n" +
          "✅ I adopted an architecture that's suitable for large-scale SaaS apps, even if this chatbot is just one small part of Dimasc.\n\n" +
          "💡 Technical Decisions:\n" +
          "✅ React Query for data fetching — reduces boilerplate, improves speed, and keeps the code clean.\n" +
          "✅ Zustand for state management — lightweight, scalable, and easy to set up.\n" +
          "✅ React Hook Form for form validation — highly structured and easy to read.\n\n" +
          "✅ Next.js Route Groups (like (foldername)) used to isolate layouts and keep layout.tsx files clean and purpose-specific.\n\n" +
          "📁 Folder Structure:\n" +
          "- The project uses the src directory to keep everything organized:\n" +
          "- src/ \n├── app/ \n├── components/ \n├── context/ \n├── data/ \n├── hooks/ \n├── lib/ \n├── stores/ \n├── types/\n" +
          "- Each part of the codebase has a clear responsibility—for example, separate files for mutations, queries, contexts, and stores. This structure helps developers understand and navigate the project quickly.\n" +
          "✨ Features:\n" +
          "✅ Authentication: \n -Sign-In (MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)) \n -Sign-Up (3-Step Process) \n -Forgot Password (Multi-Step Recovery)\n\n" +
          "✅ Chat Interface: \n -Dynamic Chat Rendering \n -Search Functionality \n -Edit Chat Title \n -Delete Chat \n -Create New Chat \n -Auto-generated Chat Titles\n\n" +
          "✅ User Settings: \n -Change Email (with MFA) \n -Change Password \n -Theme Selector \n\n" +
          "✅ Other: \n -Log Out \n -Secured Routes via Middleware\n\n" +
          "💻 Technologies:\n\n" +
          "✅ Next.js\n\n" +
          "✅ React\n\n" +
